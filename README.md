# About the app
This GitHub repository houses a drawing application created using React Native and TypeScript. With this app, users can draw over a blank canvas or use a background image from their media library or camera. The application offers users the ability to customize the brush stroke's color and thickness, as well as erase parts of the drawing or clear the entire canvas. Once complete, the user can save the drawing.
